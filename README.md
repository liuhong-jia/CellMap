# CellMapper 
CellMapper is an innovative tool crafted to precisely map individual cells onto spatial coordinates within tissue slices. Its broad utility lies in unveiling the spatial distribution of cell types, dissecting cellular compositions within tissue section spatial spots, and identifying critical functional structures within biological systems.
